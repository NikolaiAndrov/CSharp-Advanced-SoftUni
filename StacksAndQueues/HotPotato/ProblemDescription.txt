7.	Hot Potato
Hot potato is a game in which children form a circle and start passing a hot potato. 
The counting starts with the first kid. Every nth toss the child left with the potato leaves the game. 
When a kid leaves the game, it passes the potato along to its next neighbor. 
This continues until there is only one kid left.

Create a program that simulates the game of Hot Potato. 
Print every kid that is removed from the circle. In the end, print the kid that is left last.
